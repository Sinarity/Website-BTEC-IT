                    <h2>The Pangolin</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Pangolin's name comes from the Malay word 'pengguling', which means
                            'rolling up'. This is a reference to the animal's defense tactic
                            of 'rolling up' into a ball.
                        </li>
                        <li>Like anteaters, Pangolins have no teeth, and no jaw. They only have a long
                            sticky tongue that can extend up to 40cm.
                        </li>
                        <li>Panglins are solitary animals. This means that they mostly spend their
                            time hunting and their daily routines alone. The only time when they do
                            get together is when they go and mate for reproduction.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>The Giant Tortoise</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In 2012, the last remaining Giant Galapagos Tortoise of the pinto
                            island died at the age of 102 years old.</li>
                        <li>The Giant Tortoise seem to have the ability to live without water
                            or food for a little more than a year. This is impressive compared
                            to the human's limit of three days without water and two weeks without
                            food.</li>
                        <li>Despite popular beliefs, and interpretations in cartoons, the giant 
                            tortoises' shell is actually a part of their skeleton.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    <h2>The Giant Panda</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unlike their cousins, pandas have unique vertical slits for eyes instead,
                            the eyes are very similar to those belonging to domesticated cats.</li>
                        <li>During a panda's first month, the mother can be very protective, and 
                            keep contact with them almost 100% of the time, with the cub resting
                            on their front and the remaining areas covered by the head, paw or arm.</li>
                        <li>Pandas have a padded wrist bone that helps them grip bamboo easily and act like
                            a thumb. Other bears have this feature too, but pandas have theirs significantly
                            longer, making this feature unique to them.</li>
                        <li>Pandas spend around 10-16 hours a day eating, compared to a human's 1-3 hours
                            of eating time.</li>
                        <li>Pandas have this unique and odd behavior of marking their territory. A panda
                            sometimes would go into a handstand in order to urinate on the higher areas
                            of a tree, effectivly marking their scent and rendering it hard, or impossible
                            for other animals to mark their scent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>The Polar Bear</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Despite looking white, a polar bear's skin is actually black, which the fur being
                            translucent. The only reason the fur looks white is due to the translucency and
                            the snow reflecting off the fur, giving the polar bear their unique look.</li>
                        <li>Since polar bears spend most of their time at sea, they are classified as 
                            marine animals. In fact, they are the only bear species to be classified as a
                            marine animal.</li>
                        <li>Even though a polar bear's daily routine is mostly hunting, avout 2% of them
                            are actually successful. Because of this, polar bears have managed to scavenge
                            off carcasses of other successful feedings as well as vegetation and small mammals.
                        </li>
