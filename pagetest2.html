                <p>
                    The Giant Panda is one of the rarest species of animals left on Earth.
                    In the wild, pandas a located within Eastern Asia, mainly China. Pandas
                    have been widly hunted by poachers for their fur, and their home is 
                    being destoyed as we remove the bamboo for housing decorations, and 
                    other uses. Due to the findings that pandas only produce one baby at a time, and they
                    are limited to the diet of bamboo, it makes them one of the slowest species
                    to reproduce, and one of the easiest to kill off.

                <h2>The Pangolin</h2>
                <p>
                    Pangolins are scaly anteaters that roam the African savannas. They are the only known
                    mammals that are fully covered in scales. If under threat, pangolins will immediately 
                    curl up into a ball and and use their scales to protect them. At times, they may use
                    the scales on their tail in order to defend themselves. They are known to be the 
                    most trafficked animals around the world as their meat is commonly known for tradtional
                    delicacies and their scales are used for traditional medicine and folk remedies.
                    Despite all efforts of protecting the eight species of pangolins, there are still
                    growing international illegal trade in pangolins.

                    <h2>The Giant Tortoise</h2>
                    The giant tortoise is found within the Galapagos Islands. Each tortoise is unique depending 
                    on which island they are in. If the tortoise lives belongs to one of the larger islands 
                    where there is more rain, then the tortoise would have a more domed shell shape. The tortoises
                    from smaller islands usually have a unique "saddleback" shell. These tortoises have been 
                    hunted by poachers due to their meat being eaten in traditional delicacies and their shells used 
                    for traditional decorations.

                    <h2>The Polar Bear</h2>
                    Polar bears are the largest of all the bears situated around the world. Polar bears are commonly
                    located around the Arctic regions, however, they can be found in other areas, such as Alaska. Polar
                    bears are starting to become vulnerable due to the climate changes caused by humans. Polar bears
                    rely heavily on the sea ice that surrounds the Arctic as they need it to hunt, rest, mate, and in
                    some areas, to create dens. Since humans are causing the Earth to heat up, the ice that the polar 
                    bears are using are beginning to melt and shrink down in size. This means that their home is being
                    destroyed as the Earth heats up. Polar bears are also hunted for their meat in certain
                    delicacies, bones for traditional medicine, and fur for articles of clothing and housing decorations.
                    Polar bears are also dying due to natural causes. Since polar bears are built to handle the cold,
                    the heating Earth causes them to overheat and possibly die from the heat itself.

                    <h2>The Dugong</h2>
                    Dugongs (not to be confused with the manatee) are marine mammals that live on the coast of Australia
                    and East Africa. Unlike their cousins, the manatee, dugongs do not go into freshwater areas, 
                    effectively making them the only marine animals that are herbivores. Dugongs are considered vulnerable
                    due to excessive hunting and fishing, as well as their habitats being destroyed due to pollution
                    and the heating Earth. Dugongs are also getting injured by unsuspecting humans as they constantly
                    get hit by boats within the shallow waters. Populations are still depleting while others are 
                    becoming extinct.
